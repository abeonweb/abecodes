                        <h3>How it started</h3>
                        <p className="about-body">I decided to change career to web development after years in customer service.
                            I spent a lot of time working in Spain where I learnt to communicate very well
                            (kind of in the job description). Part of speaking a language is knowing how to listen.
                            Over there, I really had to listen and understand, not just the
                            language, but also the customer. I got really good because of it.</p>


                        <p className="about-body">Programming is a different kind of captivating language.  I started by learning Java.
                            I even got the OCA certification. Then I got into web development and got hooked. I enjoy
                            the development process.
                            I also enjoy problem solving.I like solving code problems every once in a while on
                            Coding Bat and Code Wars. Those can be a challenge but difficult problems are an opportunity
                            to learn something new and grow.</p>

                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
                        <p className="about-body">Knowing how to solve problems for me is kind of like the chicken and the egg.
                            Which came first, the problems or the skills needed to solve them?
                            You need to have some basic skill level to attack the problem and then solve enough problems
                            to get good at problem solving. So it helps to solve as many as you can. Of course I'm not
                            perfect and I always get stuck.</p>

                        <p className="about-body">A challenge that I had was learning when to stop being dogged and
                            ask for help (or just use google). Luckily that is in the past. Now I learn
                            faster and better because I use multiple ways to acquire the knowledge. I think
                            I'm a lot better for it.</p>

                        <h3>What the future looks like</h3>
                        <p className="about-body">To overcome a difficulty by applying yourself to the task. That is an acquired skill for me.
                            Not knowing when to ask for help was initially an issue. I struggled with this for a time.
                            and I admit it held back my progress.
                            Now I understand the advantages to my advancement in tech the ability to just accept the things I don't
                            know or can not figure out in a reasonable time frame. </p>

                        <p className="about-body">

                            I don't just get the answers from asking or searching, apply and moving on.
                            It is best to make a deliberate effort to internalize the information and apply it
                            on your on through repetition so as to retain the information. This has helped me greatly on my journey.</p>
